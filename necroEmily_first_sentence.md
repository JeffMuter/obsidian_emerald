[[NecroEmily]]

the first sentence Emily says is:
"I want to see war."

She says this as her fear of death turns into curiosity. There's some apparent instability in her mind. 

Maybe she's married with children, maybe she's not. But either way, it needs to draw questions...

In her mind, she's seriously debating the prospect of finding a method to live forever. And, terrible as it may be, she needs to see war, before being willing to risk her life. 

She wants to stay out of it, more just to see the battle, to experience what it looks like.

I can see her descending, and being willing to contact an old flame, for him to take her, smuggle her into his command quarters, so she can sneak out and see it when others aren't looking. See the battle. Walk among the healers as they look for those who can be saved.
