What do I want? Why am I interested?

I would say I'm the kind of person who's experienced enough Hell in order to experience an unadulterated amount of joy in life. I say that because when I tell you that I have one singular goal in life, which is to use my life to be the best developer I humanly can, I've done that because, at the end of the day, I constantly want to risk everything in order to strive to be closer and closer to that goal. If I only have so much time in life, why would I use it, not chasing a dream? The biggest dream I've found is wanting to be an extremely well rounded developer, and focus on specializing in very difficult high level tasks, and being able to quickly execute them.

Where DevOps comes into play, is where many companies spenda fortune maintaining existing products. Not building new features, just in isolating, locating, and fizing bugs as they arise. 

I saw DevOps as a way to detect better, detect faster, detect more, and prevent maintenance. I felt a developer

## Penultimate Slide

Want to get better? What do I suggest?
Build an http router, than a tcp server project.
My versions of this were a tcp chatroom server. Users connect via the terminal to add themselves to, and send messages in chatrooms.
Then I made an http server, no framework to make this easier, in Golang. Understanding that the web is just moving around html, css & js taught me an extraordinary amount.
2 different types of networking will make you realize what networking is, and enforce the basic concepts.
Then use E3, EC2, and whatever else you feel you need to, to set up something extremely basic, if not terrible, on your server. It will teach you a crazy amount, and you'll finally understand just enough about servers, and products to feel like you understand the basic concepts that allow businesses to run, and why services like AWS & Azure are so powerful

i want to be the absolute best developer I can. While it's great to be interested, and focused on being great at making software, I realize that I need 'ops', or IT. And to be honest, I don't want to NEED them. I want to be able to be flexible, to do things anywhere. If I was stuck, and needed to understand hardware, hosting, networking, I didn't want it to be a black box, a wall I refused to surmount. Instead, I want to be well rounded. I want to be flexible. I want to know, if I had to, I could. So I started poking around in the world of DevOps. I started hosting some projects on cloud platforms, using, and understanding the tools


The best presentation I can give, is one only I can give:

I've been through hell, so I refuse to live a dead life that bores me.

If the only way to live, is to be trained to use tools that let you take whatever you want, then my first weapon was programming. Great, now I can build anything I set my mind to.

The next problem, was solving the problem of deciding what to build, that's when I realized many new problems. Such as, if you have 10 websites, it takes you greater orders of magnitudes to maintain them.

My solution to this was devops. To be able to quickly build something, and then easily troubleshoot problems, and to spend as little time as possible maintaining the system once it's active. It places me at the center of the two worlds, between software complexity, and operation complexity. Hardware, and software, if you will. If I can master this realm well enough, I'm convinced I can push features to code faster, more consistently, with less bugs, in a scalable way between projects. Which in turn, leads to me experiencing more, learning, and growing more, and closer to where I need to be to become even more free.

Regardless.

points:
1: introduction
2: why im interested in devops
3: devops vs the cloud
4: aws services are just software used to use the cloud
5: ec2, s3, rds, iam, lambda
