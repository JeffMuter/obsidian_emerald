## The Need Comes Before The Talent

My main project has some challenges that have been petrifying me. It's an AR game, similar to Pokemon Go in that way. The only way to get your character to move, is to move in the real world.

It's similar to Factorio, in that you manage a massive network of locations, the workers you assign to work, and farm materials at said location.

Things become tricky when it comes to the main way you begin to unravel the story. A series of checks to see if any 'workers' qualify. These conditionals are almost always bound to a location, and a time, and more.

So it becomes essential for me to track the location and time of the worker at all times. 

Workers move between locations, and tracking where they are, and whether they should render becomes tricky. 

With my limited experience creating databases as complex as this one needs to be, I felt reasonably, and absolutely terrified.

I also had to begin probing into generating the terrain. I need rivers to be seen where there are rivers. Rocky terrain where there are mountains.

This is hyper complex, especially if I don't desire to ping an external API thousands of times every time a user loads their screen. Yes, it's possible to get it done, but not within a snappy amount of time.

So therein lies another piece of major functionality that terrifies me to even begin digging into.

One of the only reasons I really do use AI, is to have exploratory chats like this. After a few hours of this, I noticed a habitual need to review thoughts with ChatGPT, and a habitual noticing of myself opening up LinkedIn or Discord, for no good reason. I realized I was so scared, that I was avoiding my work in any way I could manage.
