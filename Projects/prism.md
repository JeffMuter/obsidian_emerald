ascii game that is a geo-based app. Close to ar.

TODO:
- [ ] button to submit your long/lat, saves to db
- [x] create the db
- [ ] create location table

we want to be able to 'ping' our location to a db. long, lat.

we probably want sign in.

- [ ] Need to research display.
# UI

camera doesn't need to turn.

Menus:
- display of progress & status of workers
- display nodes


Ideas:
can we have the user ping via text over phones?
should we allow the user to use phone-based terminals to play?
