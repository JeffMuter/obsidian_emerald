in [[prism]], a building is any structure that has rooms where an rpg mode begins. Not totally sure yet how I feel about this because the implication of being able to see / explore rooms in a building may simply not make sense for this kind of game. 
Would you gain access to different things / rooms within the building over time that you can explore?
Could this be the layout for how a player's base works? They can add rooms, objects, etc? Hmm.. I like that idea.

Maybe as time goes on
