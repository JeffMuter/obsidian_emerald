nodes are structures in [[prism]] that a player can send workers to. nodes have a limited number of [[resource]] that can be generated, like iron, wood, etc.. Theres a limit to the number of workers that can be working there, but any number of workers can stop by to rest if injured. The resources are unlimited, and the local terrain determines what resources can be mined. there are types of nodes, city nodes are available to any player, and have special resources, high numbers of workers can work here, water nodes can get fish, and water-related resources. Boats can be stored, etc.. Mines get ores, etc..

PostgreSQL has some functionality called 'graph', where we can somehow use this to create 'edges' between location based nodes. Interesting. Very curious to look into this after the MVP stage
