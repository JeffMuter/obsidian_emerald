oh man. this is way more of a pain that I had anticipated...

if the user has a GPS, I imagine they're fairly easy to find. However, going off of nothing but their IP is really spotty. Maybe within 13 miles for me? Just too far imo. I want to very seriously see that I am east of the city. If I am not getting that, I just can't have it.

So the other, main option for me, until I get some kind of mobile working via a phone's terminal, is to locate them based on their wife. How far from their wife is meh. What's important is that we get the lat/long of that device, and use it for the user's. Being off 50 feet isn't a big deal. the user needs to move a mile before I'm willing to update the UI.

However, there's a package to get maps working, and another package(probably) to begin working with the user's wifi. It's cool & interesting stuff, and once again, opens up my options. But
