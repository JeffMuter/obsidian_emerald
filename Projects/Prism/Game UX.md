I wanted to take a step back and refeel out what excites me about the basic gameplay of this game.

- Home screen feels like a 'command center' One part of the page is a wide-view of all my nodes, or a global map, showing where my nodes are somehow. Another part of the screen looks like some kind of display of lore, another part stats [[homescreen_UX.excalidraw]]
