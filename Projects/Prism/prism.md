ascii game that is a geo-based app. Close to ar.

TODO:
- [ ] button to submit your long/lat, saves to db
- [x] create the db
- [ ] create location table
- [ ] make func([]art) []art {} to order objects before placing them on the screen
- [ ] add tables to db
- [ ] determine way to get objects to show from db

we want to be able to 'ping' our location to a db. long, lat.

we probably want sign in.

- [ ] Need to research display.
# UI

camera doesn't need to turn.

Menus:
- display of progress & status of workers
- display nodes


Ideas:
can we have the user ping via text over phones?
should we allow the user to use phone-based terminals to play? 
take real images, and have a program turn the image into ascii.

We could do 1 char / .5mile. That way each node is a reasonable distance away visually. 

## Visuals

what can the user see?
simple commands on the bottom.
location of workers.
nodes
unique [[landmarks]]
