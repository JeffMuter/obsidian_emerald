ascii game that is a geo-based app. Close to ar. Made in the termindal

TODO:

# UI

camera doesn't need to turn.

Menus:
- display of progress & status of workers
- display nodes


Ideas:
can we have the user ping via text over phones?
should we allow the user to use phone-based terminals to play? 
take real images, and have a program turn the image into ascii.

We could do 1 char / .5mile. That way each node is a reasonable distance away visually. 

## Visuals

what can the user see?
simple commands on the bottom.
location of workers.
nodes
unique [[landmarks]]

What if we had different [[map_views]]
