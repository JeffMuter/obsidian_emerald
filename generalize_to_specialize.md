Of course these aren't all perfectly parralel positions, however, I think it's clear that having a specialty gives you more leverage. Beyond the data, I think we can all agree that having a unique, but useful ability that no one has will get you further, not just in salary, but in interviews.

My personal story started out, where I spent time learning all of the most average technologies, and not getting particularly good at any of them.

However, the important thing here is that I experimented with all of these technologies for shorter and shorter periods of time. I walked away from the experience and generally knew I wanted to pick Golang
