need to decide between a few methodologies to meet / manage workers.

One idea im not sold on is 'merging' or 'fusing' workers, in the hope to imrpove their stats.

Another concern is, how do we meet workers? currently, when creating one, I set the values of their stats. But we need to 'generate' those on a scale. 

Do we meet one when creating a location?

Is it a certain day / celestial event where users meet workers? Interesting way to draw players in to paying attention to the lunar patterns.
