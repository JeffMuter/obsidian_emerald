This blog idea is about helping devs get more uncomfortable. Maybe make this testimonial to the professional projects ive taken on at work.

I made an AI application chatbot, not because it excited me, but for a work demo. Learning about it opened up a lot of windows as to how RAG, and AI works under the hood, demystifying it.

I built a web server, it was painful, and tedious at times, but it taught me a ton about HTTP servers.

I took a greenfield project at work, and no matter how much I say I hate DevOps, learning to use Docker, WSL, K8s, GitHub Actions, Grafana, JUnit, and such. All of this forced me to think differently about how applications live and breathe, how the hardware touches them, which has been a massive point of mystification in my career. 

All of these moments of doing things I really loathed, helped to transform me, and my capabilities as a developer. What I felt comfortable taking on as a project expanded leaps and bounds. I felt far more ambitious as a result. Less nervous to do things the wrong way. By trying new things, I learned a method for tackling such unknowns. When someone has a problem, I didn't just say I don't do that, nor did I accept it right away. I learned to break the problem down, determine what the ideal tooling would be, and the tooling I knew, and tried to analyze to see if I could learn enough within a reasonable period of time to make pursuing the project a worthwhile endeavor. I am not a god, I pass on this information to leaders who can determine if the project / complexity validates the resources spent.

After this, the greatest benefit is learning about myself. What I enjoy, what I life to do, how I want to spend my time in my career doing. I wan't assuming that my current course was the best fit, I adjusted what my dream looked like, so I can aim properly at it. This is such a painfully important point, and I think when developers shirk from projects they don't like, off of little more than a feeling, it can really hurt you. I primarily learned through all of this that my current career path was, quite possibly, very wrong for me. I had an idea of who I wanted to be in 10 years, I had people I knew and in my community, that I liked, that I had a career map with my company laid out of how to get there. When I finally would have gotten there, I would maybe still not fully realize that this isn't what I wanted, and have to deviate courses so many years from now. Instead, I can say maintaining large projects, slapping on duct tape to keep it running as long as we can, was not my passion. I like to take a seemingly impossible idea, and make it possible as cheaply, and quickly as possible, so we can determine if it's a profitable idea. I love to make something slow, and make it fast and efficient. 

You might hate the idea of being a QA developer, but doing a bit of dabbling in QA tasks will help you learn about testing, and what QA is for.

The same goes for DevOps, try Docker, use
