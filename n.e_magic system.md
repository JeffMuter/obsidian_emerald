[[miracles]]

the magic system can be split in two. At least where this book is concerned, all magic comes from the 2 main gods, the god of blood, and the god of fire. The god of fire being a good guy, and the alternative for the latter. 

In exchange for some kind of servitude, the magics can be granted.
