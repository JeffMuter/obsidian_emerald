I want to write a post about reading through rows in SQL, so I can understand them better. I can copy / paste my way through the motions. But I think in order to really comprehend it, I need to spend some time trying to understand it better.

rows.Scan()
rows.Next()
db.Query()
db.QueryRow()
^^ all of these, and I'm positive there are alternatives with different functions. We need to understand them better, in order to be a better developer who can program without constant help.
