an expedition is when a network of at least 2 nodes is disconnected form the whole. 

The real version of this is when a user travels somewhere far away, and can't connect all the locations between here and home.

Let's say my main network is in Ohio, and I fly to florida, and set up a few nodes on vacation.

I drop off at least 1 worker from my 'party' (one of a shortlist of workers that travel with me personally). 

This worker stays in florida, or at least stays at one of the locations long enough for an egg to hatch, so the outpost isn't unmanned.

As many workers as are awakened here, can be managed from the menu system. But they cannot move materials, nor share lore back to the player until either:
1. this new node network eventually does connect via roads.
2. an expedition begins

So, what is an expedition?

It's when the user has any number of workers, or all, at a given location, abandon this Outpost and make a dash for the next closest location the user's made.

I imagine this like a fortified caravan, they anticipate a long travel, the danger level is very high, there will likely be wagons, or workers lost in this run home. Maybe they can stop at another Outpost to rest, recover, and even stay. Or they can continue on home.

Really, the main benefit is trying to get the lore from those workers. Get resources that you can't get access to normally. Desert nodes, port nodes, that you can't get until you connect to the outpost, or the expedition returns with those supplies. 

Anyways, won't have to try implementing this for a while, but it is a really interesting solution to travel that isn't just 'get blimp'
