	using something sort of called 'mini status line'
	no clue what it is, but maybe I can customize this to have the color theme I'm going for?

added the color alterations to the custom theme for 'polar'

looks much better, at least more useful than before.

However, there's info on this status line that I just don't care about: current git branch, I'd love to see the current git repo path, not the entire file tree from the root. utf-8, and id rather see total lines, rather than file size in bytes... But I don't care enough to tweak stuff atm.
