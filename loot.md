this is an idea built off of the giddy feeling of 'loot' from games considered 'looter shooters', ie, destiny / warframe.

Part of the time-system, of waiting periods of time in order to see changes, is based off of how it took time to craft items in Warframe, and I really appreciated having something to look forward to based on timers in the game.

Akin to the loot system, I really appreciated the feeling of 'burning' in NFTs, or 'melding' 'fusion', what-have-you.
