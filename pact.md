so we need to start a general idea of what pages need made, what functionality and all that jazz, and begin prioritizing that shit.

Home page ( logged in vs guest vs non-member )

what does a member want to see logged in?
probably just their buckets, right? mvp

Non Member Home
this is more of a marketing page. Show a picture of an example. Show a user adding a submission show the manager checking the submission off as 'approved' or what have you.
2 sections video of user story on right, description of use case on the left. then vice versa.
then show a registration form...
Currently not sure how to handle when a user has an account but their membership isn't active.

Add-Connection page...
We need a way for a member to 'connect' to another... how to handle making a connection. Usernames aren't unique. Maybe type in an email that sends a connection request.
This pages shows you connections-requests, then connections below.
