in [[prism]] I picture a few different item types, [[artifact]]s, which are powerful, deeply hidden items in the game.

[[schematic]]s, which are a sort of instruction manual, you can invest resources to make into a craftable item. Once you find a schematic of a boat, you can then make boats after investing a fairly large amount of time and energy into them. 

a more default 'item', may be a potential idea. Even turning nodes, and 'roads' into items. Where you can only get workers to a new location once you've laid the road over time.
