Emily is a woman in n.e.book. 

She has a fear of death that has been growing. A main character in the book.

## History:
Emily's families have been refugees several times. In her early teens, she grew up amidst a revolution. She participated in friend groups, supporting the revolution. But when it came, it was unbearable to watch families tear apart. During which, her grandparents, who she hardly saw, but lived in a nearby town, died after their house burned down, and no one was around to help them escape their home in time.

The following years, she saw the new people's government take over. One of fairness, and equity. Many people turned into spies. People turned in their family members, their neighbors. Fear was everywhere. People were easily gaslit into thinking they might secretly having impure political ideas, and would even turn themselves in. These people were 'rehabilitated' with cruelly forced labor, and their enslavement made them perfect military candidates. The thought was, soldiers were innately impure, so one must spare the people from such a fate. To be in the military, is to be sentenced to a life of killing, and then death.

Finally her family escaped, during a purge from the government. When food got low, the government would send more to war, imprison more, and work people until they died of starvation. A bitter, painful world she dared be raised in... During one of the mass-raids, where police would round up classes of people for execution, her family wasn't chosen, but used the mass showing of security for the event, to escape unnoticed. Tragically, her brother protested. He was too far indoctrinated. He was older than her, and her mom took her to start running, as her dad and brother fought. He told her he got her brother to calm down, and he agreed to not tell the guards, but he wanted to stay. This was a lie. Her father killed her brother. It was the only way for the rest of them to live. They, very luckily, made it all the way beyond the border. They started a new life, in a new town. Eventually, as she married Thompson, she realized her city was entering the early stages of a similar revolution over something like communism again. So when her sister died fairly young, and her parents saw where the city was going, they told her they'd go with her somewhere else. Hence they went to Thompson's city. Sadly, his city is going through a similar upheaval in the government.

## Details:
Emily is married to [[Thompson]].

4 Children

Black hair, mid-back length.

5 ft tall.

Either near 30, or 40. Not sure how I feel about her abandoning her children

Was 120 lbs before they moved, she's lost a lot of weight, 
closer to 100 now.

Used to have freckles across pale skin, but those are gone in this cold region.

Her sister died near Emily's 29th birthday. Nearing the fated year of 30, mixed with her sister dying, has filled her with a newfound discomfort with death.

Her sister left her some money, just enough that her and Thompson, and her parents, decided it was best to move to his hometown to start a coffee shop, a fantasy they always had together.
