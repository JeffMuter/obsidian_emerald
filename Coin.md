Project idea for a term casi project.

Main debate is between go or zig.

Go is great for concurrency, and doing the networking with web sockets, and crypto, if I go that dir.

But Zig sounds like a fun experiment... Decisions...

I guess a second idea is Go for all the networking, and Zig for game logic...
