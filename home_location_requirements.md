for a home location, there can only be 1

I don't think the home location can be set, except for 1 time, and after that, you need an item to reset the home location.

can the home location be set once you already have a location made? Do you get your node item back? Do we make nodes using items???... Not sure.

Instead, we change the type of node to be 'home', 

feel like it's finally time to add a new feature.

issue0: home loc type can't be set on location table, because the location isn't the same type for everyone.

solution: a type of loc on locations, and a type on users_locations... A mountain is always a mountain, but not every mountain is a 'home'... what are theoptions here?

Because each created location is always the same, we make a 'home' table? from here, we can store the buildings, worker relationships, level, etc..

home table,

buildings table

homes_buildings table
