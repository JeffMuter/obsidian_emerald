this is a project. 

the homebase is a concept for a centralized location the user can establish. This location is accessible wherever the user is. But I may consider making this location movable, and have some special details a user can access when within a mildly wide range, in case they move somewhere, they don't need to destroy their old nodes, or pay attention to where they're moving in case they're not going to be close enough to where they can place a node. It HAS to be movable, for similar reasons.

homebase is the location that all resources, item crafting, and many other management tools happens through. You can upgrade the base with large amounts of materials. resources can be moved from any location, to the homebase to store there. 

Homebase has many 'buildings' I'm thinking a storage building, astrology tower, for lore. Smith, to turn ore into ingots, or other crafting buildings to build other items.
