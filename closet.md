I have a lot of fond memories writing books in my closet. Something about feeling like nothing really needs to exist outside of the closet was really meditative, and highly improves focus. I would really be interested in getting some sort of isolation tank going again. The closest thing I currently have is the lights off in  bathroom. A nice cozy chair, a monitor in front of me, no distractions. That's a fantastic thing.
