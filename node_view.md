this view has special commands just for it.

A user can move the screen left & right, up and down, far beyond their character. 

Zoom out to a view that's basically continental. 

The user can refresh, to re-render the screen when they've zoomed their terminal for more char/screen

The user can 'snap' back to their location with a command.

The user can see the w & h of the screen in meters 

Another mode to be able to select nodes in this mode.

The user can see numbers / letter across the top to help 'select' a node. Such as in chess. 'aa 235' would refer to the 27th line horizantally, and the 235th line vertically. You get the idea since those numbers don't make sense.
