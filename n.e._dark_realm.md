this is the 'land of the dead' for those who died with a pact with the blood deity. 

In this world, it's a place where things don't grow. Only souls are brought there. while cities and buildings exist here, they're more like embodied memories. Some parts of buildings appear as older, some as newer, some as though the building hadn't been built yet. The more people remember the building, the more likely it is to take solid shape.

Across the landscape, [[nephelim]] roam. They generally don't move much. Swirling storms of souls surround them. They can be mistaken for small mountains when sleeping. These creatures are like a soul with no body. In this realm, they deeply hunger to return to their living bodies, but in this world, everyone is a spirit, there's nothing for them here to possess.
