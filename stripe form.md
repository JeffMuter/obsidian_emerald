so we ave 1-2 options here.

Apparently, there's a way to just import stripe's UI into the page, like ActiveCampaign.
I've prototyped one version of this already, but I'll have to see if there are any major cons to this.

I'd like to offer $5/m or $50/yr.

But need to keep going to see how this plays out.
need to make the page server,

and the form server.
