[[Task_Board]]

issue popped up, where all the images on brand expression overview broke, because Adam Nye's website shut down, and all those images were from his website. bringing to mind that we may need to consider creating a task to update the [[wass_testing_suite]], to check for src values that are not from cloudinary. Might ruffle some feathers.
