map views refer to the concept of adding map views. Only one kind of map, much shorter range, that shows terrain, and mayb the terrain within a square mile. From this view a user can visually see what kinds of resources would be available to a node via the view.

[[location_view]]
This view is used to show off locations in the game, and worker progress, but nothing else. Can be zoomed out to a global map.

[[terrain_view]]
Another view shows nodes / game objects within a much wider range, such as a 40mx40m square as planned, but each square may not need its own terrain. This would support less reliance on OpenStreetMaps. Currently, I just want to be as non-reliant as I can on external API's. 

[[node_view]]
able to zoom in and out, move left & right, and manage any node a player can see.
