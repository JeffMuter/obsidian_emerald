[[Game UX]] 
Id like the menus for things to look cool...For instance. When selecting a worker, I want a card to display with subcards within. One shows the worker art. Another shows the visible area around the node they're at, with all the terrain around the node, and another contains a chart with status details like strength, stamina, name, name religion, the type of work they're doing levels(once we have levels).

this sucks but you get the idea.
