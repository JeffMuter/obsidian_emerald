stoics are a political group in n.e. book.

they beleive in stoicism, and can be seen as a metaphor for republicans.

the old regime fought for the ideals of the founding fathers.

currently, a younger generation is now fighting to overtake the Stoics, instead of making their own party. Their ideals are aligned with the old regime, but they have a greater focus on feeling like the Equalist laws are destroying the nation, and soon there won't be a nation to defend. This group is based more on a Jungian mentality. Being a warrior in a garden, is better than being a gardener in a war. Their policies blantantly don't attempt to be fair, but to allow opportunity, to free people to move in society however they want.

The main conflict between the old and new regime, is that the old regime is corrupted, not idealistic, and much more willing to compromise with the Equalists.

Equalists almost never negotiate with the Stoics.
