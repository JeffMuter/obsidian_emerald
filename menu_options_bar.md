this is a UI component for prism, where in a menu, the user has a way to see what kinds of commands exist. If in the main menu, they should be able to see:

workers -- locations -- home -- etc..


Would also be nice to have an easy way to know what each does, and teach the user how to select them without typing out the whole word, an autocomplete would be amazing, if such a thing is possible.
