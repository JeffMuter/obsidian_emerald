If I have learned anything from working professionally as a programmer, it is that data is king. Data intervenes when genius is unavailable.

This is where this talk stepped in, and moved me in the direction of seeing what the world of DevOps has moving up from within. Using metrics to bear the success of what is being worked on seems obvious, but much like TDD, it isn't practiced as often as one may hope.

I have a fascination with DevOps because it feels like a required step in order to make better decisions over time. Born by metrics, less by guesswork. I am no marketing genius, I personally need these systems to help myself in my own work. So I plan to keep trying to learn, one nugget at a time.
