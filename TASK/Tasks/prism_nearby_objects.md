currently a bug where objects that begin above the screen, but the bottoms should be visible, the bottoms of said images need rendered imo. the bottom of a tower should be visible, even if its top is not visible...

or we need to render the objects from the bottom up, but then the tops of some objects need rendered... complex problem to determine how to fix... but fix we must.
