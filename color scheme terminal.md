we want to make a wintery-theme

this one's more creative. different shades of blue, white, gray, black, and some candle/ christmas colors for flavor

want to mack black / green hacker

one issue is the host name colors. having trouble editing those.
`PS1='\[\e[1;32m\]\u@\h:\w\[\e[0m\]\$ '`
this kind of gets close to the method I was trying. but seemed broken. I guess the bashrc file in ~ directory may get us closer

tried removing tokyo night theme, and just want to completely customize my own as I saw areas to improve, however, perhaps I'm conflicting with other software trying to color my stuff? I'm not sure, but I can't seem to set a new color for anything, which is crazy frustrating. Maybe it's just the punctuation that I can't but now even string coloring just doesn't work.

Okay, getting *something* working now, however, there' a long way to go in customizing these 2 themes.
I made a polar-theme.lua file in the lua/ directory. Calling it in my init.lua file which sets it. Getting an alert when I open neovim, so need to get that figured out, as well as getting more customizing and inspiration. currently, symbols & brackets are a candle-orange color. Everything else should be different shades of blue / white. Gray for comments, white for strings, I have light-blue everywhere else, but that's too many things all the exact same shade.
