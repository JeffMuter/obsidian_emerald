ipinfo.io is the service we're using

50k requests / month.
Last month we saw 55k users.
Need to add cookie caching to make sure we don't rerun this every time the same user reloads the page.
Specifically want the user to see a banner ONLY if they are in Arizona.
Banner sends them to: https://www.wasserstrom.com/restaurant-supplies-equipment/showcase-arizona
Only displays on the Wasserstrom.com/ homepage.
