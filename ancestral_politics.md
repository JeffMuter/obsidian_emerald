after death, the land of the dead has ancestors in them. These ancestors make a bond with a descendent. There is still decay in this realm.

There are the demigods. Who stand like giants, a storm of pained souls surround them in eternal torment. Anyone's greatest fear would be, being dragged into these storms.

So one of the greatest fears is, how to stop more of these collosals from being born and created? So most spirits are aligned to try and stop these. Although some would sooner see this realm brought to an end.
