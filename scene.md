a scene is a kind of location. Invisible until unlocked. A scene depicts anything in the game's lore. Visual by art, a description of it. It should be rare, beautiful, and create more questions than answers. I vaguely imagine a scene describing a religious event, visual, sort of like an icon. This could also be n interpretation of some kind of prophecy, or a moment in history. You can imaging an icon of two leaders shaking hands, and a text blurb explaining why this event was important. I think these visuals are depicted by the worker bringing them back.
